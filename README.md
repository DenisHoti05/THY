# THY - web for training participants

visit web : https://thy.netlify.app

I created a web for a training tha t I held for front-end development using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and using Google Firebase for authentication, real time database and storage.
From this website participants can download all files about front-end and upload their homeworks, but they can if they are user or they can create one!!!
After you download files you should visit : https://firebase.google.com/ ; create a project and copy the "projects id" and paste it on following files :  /course/index.html - line 70,
/course/Ushtrime/index.html - line:124 , /course/Detyra/index.html - line:141   ,   /course/Detyra/Detyra-1/index.html - line:124 , /course/Detyra/Detyra-2/index.html - line:124 ,
/contact/index.html - line:78 ;
After you have done this, you will get messages from your web, into your online database in google firebase, and all other features that supports firebase....
And you should change the rules of database for more watch tutorials for free on youtube!
